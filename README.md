# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Luxury-Beauty-Products

Problem and Approach
What is the Problem?

E-commerce has become popular in the last decade. Thousands of products are sold through platforms like Amazon, eBay, etc. One of the biggest advantages of e-commerce platforms for both customers and sellers alike is an option to rate and review the products. These reviews can be used by businesses to make major business decisions based on price optimization, demand forecasts, product comparison with the competition. In the real world situation, businesses donâ€™t have access to the sentiment label of the reviews provided by the customers. Through this project, we would like to explore different ways of unsupervised sentiment analysis for luxury beauty products sold on Amazon and find insights for the features that work for the brand.

Today Luxury Beauty Products globally is 126 Billion USD Market with 18.8 Billion USD in US alone. More than 2000 products are sold on Amazon with wide range of brands, price and categories.
